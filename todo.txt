PINGS
------------------------------------------------------------
Is it worth adding a ping service to Sprout SEO?


SETTINGS
- Fix Selected Value of Robots Fields
- Allow Open Graph Values to be set as "Same as Meta Title, Same as Meta Description ..."
	If we do this, can we pull in what will be displaying there as placeholder="" text so that there is no doubt what will display to the end user if they don't want to override?

FIELDTYPES
- Sprout SEO Basic
- Sprout SEO Robots
- Sprout SEO Location
- Sprout SEO Facebook Open Graph 

ALso have a "SEO Template" field type where a person could select which SEO Fallback Template to use on a page.  This would just be a drop down of the items added in the Fallback area.

CODE

Add a tab that outputs the necessary twig code

UI IMPROVEMENTS

Can we build in some feedback like Yoast SEO does, telling folks how many characters are recommended for certain fields like Title and Description?

Can we also have Keyword Analysis telling folks how many times certain keywords are used?  Or have them add their target keywords and use that info to analyze where there are opportunities in the content fields.

Can we do something like SEO moz that looks for how many H1's/H2's and so on are on a given page and visualizes some feedback?

============================================================

IMPROVE TEMPLATE CASCADE

Maybe we can have the "layouts" default to the first section in the URL, and if we want something more specfic, we can override that.

So, when the page /blog/post loads, Sprout SEO will check for the "template_name" value, if it doesn't find one, it will then check for a template named "blog" and if that is not present, it will fall back to "default", which will be the one required SEO template.

Can I create an Sprout SEO FieldType that just stores an ID of a separate SproutSEO table I've created?  And then whenever an entry is saved, that seo_id is updated and all the fields in that other table are updated?

------------------------------------------------------------

PRICING

Consider a pricing model where the 'Basic Field' and one Fallback template are free, and more advanced fields and fallback templates cost money... I really don't like this model because I always resist paying more for something that almost works as a free option.  May be best to just have a low price point. $5.  $10.





NOTES
------------------------------------------------------------

How does wordpress do 301 redirects from the CP?  Can we do this somehow?
